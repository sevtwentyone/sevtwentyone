### Hey! I'm Åževket Tekin!

I have a degree in English Language Teaching but I've always been interested in programming. I'm based in Antalya, Turkey.
Since the day I turned on my first computer back in 2009, I always wanted to make my thoughts come true using computers and programming.
And I'm also a huge fan of Tame Impala.

### What am I doing right now?

I'm currently developing an OpenGL library that I'm planning to turn into a simple game engine later.
I think that's all I can say for now.
